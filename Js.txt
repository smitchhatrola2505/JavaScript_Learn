    -> JavaScript can be used to create cookies
    -> JavaScript is a full-featured programming language

What makes JavaScript unique ? 

    -> Support by all major browser and enabled by default

Js In Html Page : 

    -> Internal : <script type="text/JavaScript"> //js code goes hear </script>

    -> External :  <script src="index.js"> </script>

Important Function : 

    -> alert()
    -> confirm()
    -> console.log()
    -> document.write()
    -> prompt()

        alert() : it is used to alert the user that something has happend.

        prompt(msg,default) : Creates an dialog for user input 

Variable : 

    -> Variable are containers which hold reusable data

    -> it is the basic unit of storage in a program

    -> The value store in a Variable can be changed during program execution 

    Ex. var name;

    Scope : 

        -> Variable declared within a Function are local to that Function

        -> Variable declared outside of any Function are global Variable

    Life time : 

        -> Local Variable's life time is within the block of its declaration

        -> Global Variable's life time is throughout the program

Put & Get data from Html : 

    -> document.getElementById() : var x = document.getElementById("main").innerHTML;

    -> document.getElementsByClassName() :  var x = document.getElementsByClassName("main")[0].innerHTML;
                                            alert(x);
       innerHTML()

String Concatenation (+) : 

    -> var z = "hello" + "Everyone" ;
       alert(z);

    -> var a = "hello";
       var b = "Everyone";
       var c = a + b ;

Operator & Types Of Operator : 

    -> Arithmetic : +, -, *, /, %(remainder), ++, --
    
    -> Logical :  &&, ||
    
    -> Ternary : <condition> ? "yes" : "no"
    
    -> Assignment : =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

    -> Comparison : ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= 

Functions : 

    -> Function are group of code or program which is used more often. 

    -> It leads programming to code reusability and clean code.

    types : 

        (i). Pre defined : alert()... etc...
        
        (ii). User defined : 
        
            function <functionName>(){
            
                //function body 
            
            }      

            Arguments : 

            function <functionName>(a,b){

                //function body.
            
            }
    
    Call UDF On Click Event : 

     <button onclick="name_()">Submit</button>

     function name_(){
        var x = document.getElementById("name").value;
        var y = "Hello " + x;
        alert(y);   
     }
